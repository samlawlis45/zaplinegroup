**Revenue Model:** Subscription-based (SMBâ€“midmarket focus)

## 5. Market Opportunity

- **EDI Market:** ~$1.5B globally, steady demand due to retail/CPG/healthcare mandates
- **API-led Connectivity/iPaaS:** >$13B market, high growth (20%+ CAGR)

### Target Clients
- Mid-market manufacturers, distributors, 3PLs, and logistics firms
- Enterprises implementing or upgrading ERP/TMS/WMS
- SaaS/iPaaS vendors needing integration partners

## 6. Go-to-Market Strategy

### Consulting (Immediate)
- **Partnerships:** Build referral/subcontract relationships with SIs and iPaaS vendors
- **Direct Sales:** Target mid-market companies via LinkedIn, cold outreach, and industry events
- **Inbound Marketing:** Publish thought leadership on "EDI to API migration" and "fast partner onboarding"

### SaaS (Later)
- Use consulting projects to validate common pain points
- Beta-test Zapline Connect with consulting clients
- Grow via integrations marketplace listings (NetSuite, Shopify, Cleo)

## 7. Business Model

### Consulting Revenue
- $150â€“$250/hr blended rates
- Project sizes: $25kâ€“$250k depending on scope
- Retainers for ongoing support

### SaaS Revenue
- Tiered subscription pricing ($500â€“$2,500/month depending on partner count and features)
- Long-term shift to recurring revenue

## 8. Competitive Advantage

- **Hybrid Focus:** Most boutiques are either EDI-only or API-only. Zapline blends both
- **Flexibility:** As "Zapline Group" (not "Consulting"), brand supports both advisory and SaaS
- **Experience:** Deep ERP/TMS/EDI domain knowledge not easily replaced by generic SIs
- **Domain Assets:** Owning zapline.io/.app/.com variants builds a strong, unified brand

## 9. Financial Projections (High-Level)

### Year 1
- **Revenue:** $300kâ€“$500k (consulting only)
- **Clients:** 5â€“8 mid-market projects
- **Goal:** Establish SI/iPaaS partnerships

### Year 2
- **Revenue:** $750kâ€“$1.2M
- **Clients:** 10â€“15
- **Focus:** Begin SaaS prototype development

### Year 3
- **Revenue:** $1.5M+ consulting + initial SaaS ARR of $200kâ€“$500k
- **SaaS:** Early adopter base of 10â€“20 clients

## 10. Risks & Mitigation

- **Dependence on consulting cashflow** â†’ Mitigate by reinvesting into SaaS R&D
- **Competition with larger SIs** â†’ Focus on mid-market where agility matters
- **Shifting tech (API over EDI)** â†’ Position as transition experts, not just EDI implementers
